Footwork is tested on the following browsers:

 * Mozilla Firefox (versions 3.5 - current)
 * Google Chrome (current)
 * Microsoft Edge (current)
 * Microsoft Internet Explorer (versions 6 - 11)
 * Apple Safari for Mac OS (current)
 * Apple Safari for iOS (versions 6 - 8)
 * Opera (current version)

It's very likely that Footwork also works on older and newer versions of these browsers, but there's only so many combinations we can check regularly! At the time of the last check, Footwork was also found to work on the following browsers (though we don't recheck these for every release):

 * Google Android OS browser
 * Opera Mini
 * Google Chrome 5+
 * iOS Safari 5
 * Mac OS X Safari 3.1.2+

To get a good idea of how Footwork will run on another browser or platform, simply [run the test suite](../spec/runner.html). This will validate hundreds of behavioral specifications and produce a report of any problems. The pass rate should be 100% on all the browsers listed above.
