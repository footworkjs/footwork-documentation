The `disable` binding causes the associated DOM element to be disabled only when the parameter value is `true`. This is useful with form elements like `input`, `select`, and `textarea`.

!!! Note
    This is the mirror image of the `enable` binding. For more information, see [documentation for the enable binding](enable-binding.md), because `disable` works in exactly the same way except that it negates whatever parameter you pass to it.
